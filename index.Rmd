## About this handbook

This is a free community-built R reference guide written by and for epidemiologists, providing task-oriented emphasizing task-centered guidance for field and applied epidemiology.  

This book strives to be:  

* A quick reference guide - not a textbook  
* Accessible to epidemiologists and public health practitioners with limited technical support and in low internet-connectivity settings
* Clear and easy-to-read, with step-by-step instructions and many comments  
* A living document, growing and adapting to new best practices  


**Objective**  

**A free open-access digital R reference book catered to epidemiologists and public health practitioners that is usable offline and addresses common epidemiological tasks via clear text explanations, step-by-step instructions, and best practice R code examples**

Epis using R must often Google search and read dozens of forum pages to complete common data manipulation and visualization epi tasks. However, field epidemiologists often work in low internet-connectivity environments and have limited technical support. This handbook aims to fill this gap.  

  
**How to read this handbook:**
