## Preparation
<h2> Preparation </h2>


### Packages  

This code chunk shows the loading of packages required for the analyses. 

```{r epicurve_packages}
pacman::p_load(rio,          # File import
               here,         # File locator
               tidyverse,    # data management + ggplot2 graphics
               lubridate,    # working with  dates    
               aweek,        # alternative package for working with dates
               incidence,    # an option for epicurves of linelist data
               stringr,      # Search and manipulate character strings
               forcats,      # working with factors
               RColorBrewer) # Color palettes from colorbrewer2.org
```


### Load data  

Two example datasets are used in this section:  

* Linelist of individual cases from a simulated epidemic  
* Aggregated counts by hospital from the same simulated epidemic  

The dataset is imported using the `import()` function from the *rio* package. See the *page on importing data* for various ways to import data. The linelist and aggregated versions of the data are displayed below.

For most of this document, the *linelist dataset* will be used. The aggregated counts dataset will be used at the end.  

```{r epicurve_load_hide, echo=F}
# import the linelist into R
linelist <- rio::import(here::here("data", "linelist_cleaned.rds"))

# import the counts data into R
count_data <- linelist %>% 
  group_by(hospital, date_hospitalisation) %>% 
  summarize(n_cases = dplyr::n()) %>% 
  filter(date_hospitalisation > as.Date("2013-06-01")) %>% 
  ungroup()
```

```{r epicurve_load_show, eval=F}
# import the linelist
linelist <- rio::import("linelist_cleaned.xlsx")
```

Review the two datasets and notice the differences  

**Case linelist**

The first 50 rows are displayed
```{r, message=FALSE, echo=F}
# display the linelist data as a table
DT::datatable(head(linelist, 50), rownames = FALSE, filter="top", options = list(pageLength = 5, scrollX=T) )
```

**Case counts aggregated by hospital**  

The first 50 rows are displayed  

```{r message=FALSE, echo=F}
# display the linelist data as a table
DT::datatable(head(count_data, 50), rownames = FALSE, filter="top", options = list(pageLength = 5, scrollX=T) )
```




### Set parameters

You may want to set certain parameters for production of a report, such as the date for which the data is current (the "data date"). 
You can then reference the `data_date` in the code when applying filters or in captions that auto-update.

```{r set_parameters}
## set the report date for the report
## note: can be set to Sys.Date() for the current date
data_date <- as.Date("2015-05-15")
```



### Verify dates

Verify that each relevant date column is class Date and has an appropriate range of values. This `for` loop prints a histogram for each column.  

```{r verify_dates, out.width = c('50%', '50%', '50%'), fig.show='hold'}
# create character vector of column names 
DateCols <- as.character(tidyselect::vars_select(names(linelist), matches("date|Date|dt")))

# Produce histogram of each date column
for (Col in DateCols) {     # open loop. iterate for each name in vector DateCols
  hist(linelist[, Col],     # print histogram of the column in linelist dataframe
       breaks = 50,         # number of breaks for the histogram
       xlab = Col)          # x-axis label is the name of the column
  }                         # close the loop
```

## `incidence` package {.tabset .tabset-fade}
<h2> `incidence` package </h2>

Below are tabs on making quick epicurves using the **incidence** package  

<span style="color: orange;">**_CAUTION:_** Epicontacts expects data to be in a "linelist" format of one row per case (not aggregated). If your data is aggregated counts, look to the ggplot epicurves tab.</span>

<span style="color: darkgreen;">**_TIP:_** The documentation for plotting an **incidence** object can be accessed by entering `?plot.incidence` in your R console.</span>

https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/incidence/vignettes/customize_plot.html#example-data-simulated-ebola-outbreak   




<!-- ======================================================= -->
### Intro {.tabset .tabset-fade}
<h3> Intro </h3>

**2 steps are requires to plot an epicurve with the *incidence* package:**  

1) **Create** an *incidence object* (using the function `incidence()`)  
    + Provide the case linelist  
    + Specify the *time interval* into which the cases should be aggregated (daily, weekly, monthly..)  
    + Specify any sub-groups  
2) **Plot** the incidence object  
    + Specify labels, aesthetic themes, etc.  


**A simple example** - an epicurve of daily cases:  

```{r}
# load incidence package
library(incidence)

# create the incidence object using data by day
epi_day   <- incidence(linelist$date_onset,  # the linelist data
                       interval = "day")     # the time interval

# plot the incidence object
plot(epi_day)
```

**Change time interval of case aggregation (bars)**  

The `interval` argument defines how the observations are grouped. Available options include all the options from the package **aweek**, including but not limited to:  

* "week" (Monday start day is default)  
* "2 weeks" (or 3, 4, 5...)  
* "Sunday week"  
* "2 Sunday weeks" (or 3, 4, 5...)  
* "MMWRweek" (starts on Sunday - see US CDC)  
* "month" (1st of month)  
* "quarter" (1st of month of quarter)
* "2 months" (or 3, 4, 5...)  
* "year" (1st day of calendar year)  

Below are examples of how different intervals look when applied to the linelist.  
Format and frequency of the date *labels* on the x-axis are the defaults for the specified interval.  

```{r incidence, out.width=c('50%', '50%', '50%', '50%'), fig.show='hold'}
# Create the incidence objects (with different intervals)
##############################
# Weekly (Monday week by default)
epi_wk      <- incidence(linelist$date_onset, interval = "Monday week")

# Sunday week
epi_Sun_wk  <- incidence(linelist$date_onset, interval = "Sunday week")

# Three weeks (Monday weeks by default)
epi_3wk     <- incidence(linelist$date_onset, interval = "3 weeks")

# Monthly
epi_month   <- incidence(linelist$date_onset, interval = "month")

# Plot the incidence objects (+ titles for clarity)
############################
plot(epi_wk)+     labs(title = "Monday weeks")
plot(epi_Sun_wk)+ labs(title = "Sunday weeks")
plot(epi_3wk)+    labs(title = "Every 3 Monday weeks")
plot(epi_month)+  labs(title = "Months")
```


<!-- ======================================================= -->
### Modifications {.tabset .tabset-fade}
<h3> Modifications </h3>

The **incidence** package enables modifications in the following ways:  

* Arguments of `plot()` (e.g. `show_cases`, `col_pal`, `alpha`...)  
* `scale_x_incidence()` and `make_labels()`  
* `ggplot()` additions via the `+` operator  

Read details in the Help files by entering `?scale_x_incidence` and `?plot.incidence` in the R console. Online vignettes are listed in the resources tab.  




#### `plot()` modifications  
<h4> `plot()` modifications </h4>

A incidence plot can be modified in the following ways. Type `?plot.incidence` in the R console for more details.  

* `show_cases = `  If TRUE, each case is shows as a box. Best on smaller outbreaks.  
* `color = `       Color of case bars/boxes  
* `border = `      Color of line around boxes, if `show_cases = TRUE`  
* `alpha = `       Transparency of case bars/boxes (1 is fully opaque, 0 is fully transparent)  
* `xlab = `        Title of x-axis (axis labels can also be applied using `labs()` from ggplot)  
* `ylab = `        Title of y-axis; defaults to user-defined incidence time interval  
* `labels_week = ` Logical, indicate whether x-axis labels are in week or date format, absent other modifications
* `n_breaks = `    Number of x-axis label breaks, absent other modifications  
* `first_date`, `last_date` Dates used to trim the plot  

See examples of these arguments in the subsequent tabs.  


#### Filtered data
<h4> Filtered data </h4>

**To plot the epicurve of a subset of data:**  

1) Filter the linelist data  
2) Feed the subset to the `incidence()` command  

The example below uses data filtered to show only cases at Central Hospital.  

```{r incidence_filtered}
# filter the dataset
central_data <- linelist %>% 
  filter(hospital == "Central Hospital")

# create incidence object using subset of data
central_outbreak <- incidence(central_data$date_onset, interval = "week")

# plot
plot(central_outbreak) + labs(title = "Weekly case incidence at Central Hospital")
```


#### Date-axis labels/gridlines {.tabset .tabset-fade} 
<h4> Date-axis labels/gridlines </h4>

<span style="color: darkgreen;">**_TIP:_** Remember that date-axis **labels** are independent from the aggregation of the data into bars</span>


**Modify the bars**  
The aggregation of data into bars occurs when you set the `interval =` when creating the incidence object. The options for `interval` come from the package **aweek** and include options like "day", "Monday week", "Sunday week", "month", "2 weeks", etc. See the incidence intro tab for more information. 


**Modify date-axis labels (frequency & format)**  

If working with the **incidence** package, you have several options to make these modifications. Some utilize the **incidence** package functions `scale_x_date()` and `make_breaks()`, others use the **ggplot2** function `scale_x_date()`, and others use a combination.  

<span style="color: red;">**_DANGER:_** Be cautious setting the y-axis scale breaks (e.g. 0 to 30 by 5: `seq(0, 30, 5)`). Static numbers can cut-off your data if the data changes!.</span>


##### Option 1: `scale_x_incidence()` only  
1) Add `scale_x_incidence()` from the **incidence** package:  
    + Why use this approach?  
      + **Advantages**: Short code. Auto-adjusts weekly labels to interval of incidence object (Monday, Sunday weeks, etc.)  
      + **Disadvantages**: Cannot make fine adjustments to label format or minor vertical gridlines between labels  
    + Provide the name of the incidence object to ensure labels align with specified `interval` (e.g. Sundays or Mondays)
    + *optional:* `n_breaks` specify number of date labels, which start from the *interval* of the first case.  
      + for breaks every nth week, use `n_breaks = nrow(i)/n` ("i" is the incidence object name and "n" is a number)  
    + *optional:* `labels_week` labels formatted as either weeks (YYYY-Www) or dates (YYYY-MM-DD)  
    + One vertical gridline will appear per date label  

Other notes:  

* Type `?scale_x_incidence` into the R console to see more information.  
* If incidence interval is "month", n_breaks and labels_week will behave differently  
* Adding `scale_x_date()` to the plot will remove labels created by `scale_x_incidence`  
* *Note in plot below that the first label is 27 April 2014, the Sunday before the first case (May 1), aligning with Sunday weeks of the incidence object.*

```{r}
# create weekly incidence object (Sunday weeks)
i <- incidence(central_data$date_onset, interval = "Sunday week")

plot(i)+
  scale_x_incidence(i,                    # name of incidence object
                    labels_week = F,      # show dates instead of weeks
                    n_breaks = nrow(i)/8) # breaks every 8 weeks from week of first case
```
 
##### Option 2: `scale_x_date()` and `make_breaks()`  

2) Add `scale_x_date()` from **ggplot2**, but also leverage `make_breaks()` from **incidence**:  
    + Why use this approach?  
      + **Advantages**: Best of both worlds: weekly labels auto-aligned to incidence interval, *and* you can make detailed adjustments to label format
      + **Disadvantages**: *If* minor gridlines between Sunday-week date labels are desired, they are not auto-aligned  
    + After creating the incidence object, use `make_breaks()` to define date label breaks  
      + `make_breaks()` is similar to `scale_x_incidence()` (described above). Provide the incidence object name and optionally `n_breaks` as described before.
    + Add `scale_x_date()` to the plot:  
      + `breaks =` provide the breaks vector you created with `make_breaks()`, followed by `$breaks` (see example below)
      + `date_labels =` provide a format for the date labels (e.g. "%d %b") (use "\n" for new line)  

```{r}
# Break modification using scale_x_date() and make_breaks()
###########################################################
# make incidence object
i <- incidence(central_data$date_onset, interval = "Monday week")

# make breaks
i_labels <-  make_breaks(i, n_breaks = nrow(i)/6) # using interval from i, breaks every 6 weeks

# plot
plot(i)+
  scale_x_date(breaks      = i_labels$breaks, # call the breaks
               date_labels = "%d\n%b '%y",    # date format
               date_minor_breaks = "weeks")   # gridlines each week (aligns with Sundays only)  
```

##### Option 3: Use `scale_x_date()` only  

3) **Use `scale_x_date()` only** 
    + **Advantages**: Complete control over breaks, labels, gridlines, and plot width  
    + **Disadvantages**: More code required, more opportunity to make mistakes.  
    + If your incidence *intervals* are days or **Monday weeks**, (easy!):  
      + Provide interval to `date_breaks = ` (e.g. "day", "week", "2 weeks", "month", "year")
      + Provide interval to `date_minor_breaks = ` for vertical lines between date labels  
    + If your incidence *intervals* are **Sunday weeks**, it is more complex - see the tab for a Sunday week example  
      + Provide a sequence of Sunday dates to `breaks = ` and to `minor_breaks = `  
    + Use `date_labels = ` for formatting (see Dates page for tips)  
    + Add the argument `expand = c(0,0)` to start labels at the first incidence bar. Otherwise, first label will shift depending on your specified label interval.   
 
*Note: if using aggregated counts (for example an epiweek x-axis) your x-axis may not be Date class and may require use `scale_x_discrete()` instead of `scale_x_date()` - see ggplot tips page for more details.  


```{r}
# Break modification using scale_x_date() only
##############################################
# make incidence object
i <- incidence(central_data$date_onset, interval = "Monday week")

# plot
plot(i)+
  scale_x_date(expand            = c(0,0),         # remove excess x-axis space below and after case bars
               date_breaks       = "3 weeks",      # labels appear every 3 Monday weeks
               date_minor_breaks = "week",         # vertical lines appear every Monday week
               date_labels       = "%d\n%b\n'%y")  # date labels format 

```



##### A Sunday week example  

If you want a plot of Sunday weeks and also finely-adjusted label formats, you might find a code example helpful.  
Here is an example of producing a weekly epicurve using **incidence** for Sunday weeks, with finely-adjusted date labels through `scale_x_date()`:  

```{r}
# load packages
pacman::p_load(tidyverse,  # for ggplot
               incidence,  # for epicurve
               lubridate)  # for floor_date() and ceiling_date()

# create incidence object (specifying SUNDAY weeks)
central_outbreak <- incidence(central_data$date_onset, interval = "Sunday week") # equivalent to "MMWRweek" (see US CDC)

# plot() the incidence object
plot(central_outbreak)+                  
  
  ### ggplot() commands added to the plot
  # scale modifications 
  scale_x_date(
    expand = c(0,0),                 # remove excess x-axis space below and after case bars
    
    # sequence by 3 weeks, from Sunday before first case to Sunday after last case
    breaks = seq.Date(from = as.Date(floor_date(min(central_data$date_onset, na.rm=T),   "week", week_start = 7)),
                      to   = as.Date(ceiling_date(max(central_data$date_onset, na.rm=T), "week", week_start = 7)),
                      by   = "3 weeks"),
    
    # sequence by week, from Sunday before first case to Sunday after last case
    minor_breaks = seq.Date(from = as.Date(floor_date(min(central_data$date_onset, na.rm=T),   "week", week_start = 7)),
                            to   = as.Date(ceiling_date(max(central_data$date_onset, na.rm=T), "week", week_start = 7)),
                            by   = "7 days"),
    # date labels
    date_labels = "%d\n%b'%y")+       # adjust how dates are displayed
  
  scale_y_continuous(
    expand = c(0,0),                  # remove excess space under x-axis
    breaks = seq(0, 30, 5))+          # adjust y-axis intervals
  
  # Aesthetic themes
  theme_minimal()+                    # simplify background
  theme(
    axis.title = element_text(size = 12, face = "bold"),       # axis titles formatting
    plot.caption = element_text(face = "italic", hjust = 0))+  # caption formatting, left-aligned
  
  # Plot labels
  labs(x = "Week of symptom onset (Sunday weeks)", 
       y = "Weekly case incidence", 
       title = "Weekly case incidence at Central Hospital",
       #subtitle = "",
       caption  = stringr::str_glue("n = {nrow(central_data)} from Central Hospital; Case onsets range from {format(min(central_data$date_onset, na.rm=T), format = '%a %d %b %Y')} to {format(max(central_data$date_onset, na.rm=T), format = '%a %d %b %Y')}\n{nrow(central_data %>% filter(is.na(date_onset)))} cases missing date of onset and not shown"))
```


#### Show individual cases
<h4> Show individual cases </h4>

**To show boxes around each individual case, use the argument `show_cases = TRUE` in the `plot()` function.**  

Boxes around each case can be more reader-friendly, if the outbreak is of a small size. Boxes can be applied when the interval is days, weeks, or any other time period.  The code below creates the *weekly* epicurve for a smaller outbreak (only cases from Central Hospital), with boxes around each case.  

```{r}
# create filtered dataset for Central Hospital
central_data  <- linelist %>% 
  filter(hospital == "Central Hospital")

# create incidence object (weekly)
central_outbreak <- incidence(central_data$date_onset, interval = "Monday week")

# plot outbreak
plot(central_outbreak,
     show_cases = T)                 # show boxes around individual cases
```

The same epicurve showing individual cases, but with other aesthetic modifications:  

```{r}
# add plot() arguments and ggplot() commands
plot(central_outbreak,
     show_cases = T,                 # show boxes around each individual case
     color = "lightblue",            # color inside boxes
     border = "darkblue",            # color of border around boxes
     alpha = 0.5)+                    # transparency
  
  ### ggplot() commands added to the plot
  # scale modifications
  scale_x_date(
    expand            = c(0,0),         # remove excess x-axis space below and after case bars

  # plot labels
  labs(x = "Week of symptom onset (Monday weeks)", 
       y = "Weekly reported cases", 
       title = "Weekly case incidence at Central Hospital",
       #subtitle = "",
       caption  = stringr::str_glue("n = {nrow(central_data)} from Central Hospital; Case onsets range from {format(min(central_data$date_onset, na.rm=T), format = '%a %d %b %Y')} to {format(max(central_data$date_onset, na.rm=T), format = '%a %d %b %Y')}\n{nrow(central_data %>% filter(is.na(date_onset)))} cases missing date of onset and not shown"))
```




#### Color by value
<h4> Color by value </h4>

To color the cases by value, provide the column to the `groups =` argument in the `incidence()` command. In the example below the cases are colored by their age category. Note the use of `incidence()` argument `na_as_group = `. If TRUE (by default) missing values (`NA`) will form their own group.  

```{r }
# Create incidence object, with data grouped by age category
age_outbreak <- incidence(linelist$date_onset,            # date of onset for x-axis
                               interval = "week",         # weekly aggregation of cases
                               groups = linelist$age_cat, # color by age_cat value
                               na_as_group = TRUE)        # missing values assigned their own group


# plot the epicurve
plot(age_outbreak) 
```

**Adjusting order**  

To adjust the order of group appearance (on plot and in legend), the group column must be class Factor. Adjust the order by adjusting the order of the levels (including `NA`). Below is an example with gender groups using data from Central Hospital only.  

* First, the dataset is defined and gender is re-defined as a factor  
* The order of levels of gender are defined with `NA` first, so it appears on the top of the bars  
* More appropriate labels are defined for each factor level - these appear in the legend  
* The argument `exclude = NULL` in `factor()` is necessary to adjust the order of `NA`, which is excluded by default.  
* Title of legend adjusted using `fill = ` in `labs()`

You can read more about factors in their page (LINK)

                         labels = c("Missing", "Female", "Male"),

           y = "Weekly case incidence",
           x = "Week of symptom onset")      
```

#### Change colors and legend  
<h4> Change colors and legend </h4>

**To change the legend**  
Use `ggplot()` commands such as:  

* `theme(legend.position = "top")` (or "bottom", "left", "right")
* `theme(legend.direction = "horizontal")`  
* `theme(legend.title = element_blank())` to have no title  

See the page of ggplot() tips for more details on legends.  


**To specify colors manually**, provide the name of the color or a character vector of multiple colors to the argument `color = `. Note to function properly the number of colors listed must equal the number of groups (be aware of missing values as a group)  

```{r out.width = c('50%', '50%'), fig.show='hold'}
# weekly outbreak by hospital
hosp_outbreak <- incidence(linelist$date_onset, 
                               interval = "week", 
                               groups = linelist$hospital,
                               na_as_group = FALSE)   # Missing values not assigned their own group
# default colors
plot(hosp_outbreak)

# manual colors
plot(hosp_outbreak, color = c("darkgreen", "darkblue", "purple", "grey", "yellow", "orange"))

```

          
**To change the color palette**  
Use the argument `col_pal` in `plot()` to change the color palette to one of the default **base** R palettes (do *not* put the name of the palette in quotes).  

Other palettes include TO DO add page with palette names... To DO

```{r out.width = c('50%', '50%'), fig.show='hold'}
# Create incidence object, with data grouped by age category
age_outbreak <- incidence(linelist$date_onset,            # date of onset for x-axis
                               interval = "week",         # weekly aggregation of cases
                               groups = linelist$age_cat, # color by age_cat value
                               na_as_group = TRUE)        # missing values assigned their own group

# plot the epicurve
plot(age_outbreak)

# plot with different color palette
plot(age_outbreak, col_pal = rainbow)
```



#### Facets/small multiples  
<h4> Facets/small multiples </h4>

To facet the plot by a variable (make "small multiples"), see the tab on epicurves with `ggplot()` 




<!-- ======================================================= -->
## `ggplot()` {.tabset .tabset-fade}
<h2> `ggplot()` </h2>

Below are tabs on using the **ggplot2** package to produce epicurves from a linelist dataset.

Unlike using **incidence** package, you must manually control the aggregation of the data (into weeks, months, etc) *and* the labels on the date axis. If not carefully managed, this can lead to many headaches.  

These tabs use a subset of the `linelist` dataset - only the cases from Central Hospital.  

```{r}
central_data <- linelist %>% 
  filter(hospital == "Central Hospital")
```



<!-- ======================================================= -->
### Intro {.tabset .tabset-fade}
<h3> Intro </h3>

To produce an epicurve with `ggplot()` there are three main elements:  

* A histogram, to aggregate the linelisted cases into "bins" and display bars of the counts per bin (potentially by grouped values)  
* Scales for the axes and their associated labels (see tab on modifications)
* Aesthetic themes for the plot, including titles, labels, captions, etc.

Below is perhaps the most simple code to produce daily and weekly epicurves. Axis scales and labels use default options.    

``` {r ggplot_simple,  out.width = c('50%', '50%'), fig.show='hold'}
# daily 
ggplot(data = central_data, aes(x = date_onset)) +  # x column must be class Date
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1)+                     # date values binned by 1 day 
  labs(title = "Daily")

# weekly
ggplot(data = central_data, aes(x = date_onset)) +  
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 7)+                     # date values binned each 7 days (arbitrary 7 days!) 
  labs(title = "Weekly")
```
<span style="color: orange;">**_CAUTION:_** Using `binwidth = 7` starts the first bin at the first case, which could be any day of the week! To create specific Monday or Sunday weeks, see below .</span>

To create weekly epicurves where the bins begin on a specific day of the week (e.g. Monday, Sunday), specify the histogram `breaks = ` manually (not `binwidth`). This can be done by creating a sequence of dates using `seq.Date()` from **base** R. You can start/end the sequence at a specific date (`as.Date("YYYY-MM-DD")`, or write flexible code to begin the sequence at a specific day of the week before the first case. An example of creating such weekly breaks is below:  

```{r eval=F}
seq.Date(from = as.Date(floor_date(min(central_data$date_onset, na.rm=T),   "week", week_start = 1)),
         to   = as.Date(ceiling_date(max(central_data$date_onset, na.rm=T), "week", week_start = 1)),
         by   = "7 days")
```  

To achieve the "from" value (earliest date of the sequence), the minimum value in the column `date_onset` is fed to `floor_date()` from the **lubridate** package, which according to the above specified arguments produces the start date of that "week", given that the start of each week is a Monday (`week_start = 1`). Likewise, the "to" value (end date of the sequence) is specified using the inverse `ceiling_date()` function to produce the Monday *after* the last case. The "by" argument can be set to any length of days, weeks, or months.   

This code is applied to create the histogram breaks, and also the breaks for the date labels. Read more about the date labels in the Modifications tab. Defining your breaks like above will be necessary if your weekly bins are not by Monday weeks. 

Below is detailed code to produce weekly epicurves for Monday and Sunday weeks. See the tab on Modifications (axes) to learn the nuances of date-axis label management.  

**Monday weeks**  

Of note:  

* The break points of the *histogram bins* are specified manually to begin the Monday (`week_start = 1`) before the earliest case and to end the Monday after the last case (see explanation above).  
* The breaks for *date labels* on x-axis - because the bins are Monday weeks this code uses `date_breaks =` within `scale_x_date()`, which also uses Monday weeks. Sunday weeks use a different method.  
* Minor vertical gridlines between date labels are made using `date_minor_breaks = ` within `scale_x_date()`, again because this plot is for Monday weeks. Sunday weeks use a different method.  
* Adding `expand = c(0,0)` to the x and y scales removes excess space on each side of the plot, which also ensures the labels begin at the first bar.  
* Color and fill are defined in `geom_histogram()`

        axis.title = element_text(face = "bold"))+               # axis titles in bold

  labs(title    = "Weekly incidence of cases (Monday weeks)",
       subtitle = "Subtitle: Note alignment of bars, vertical lines, and axis labels on Mondays",

```

**Sunday weeks**  

The below code creates a histogram of the rows, using a date column as the x-axis. Of note:  

* The break points of the *histogram bins* are specified manually to begin the Sunday (`week_start = 7`) before the earliest case and to end the Monday after the last case (see explanation above). 
* The breaks for *date labels* on the x-axis and vertical gridlines - because the bins are *not* Monday weeks, manually specified vectors of dates are given to `breaks =` and `minor_breaks = ` within `scale_x_date()`. You *cannot* use the `scale_x_date()` arguments of `date_breaks` and `date_minor_breaks` as these align with Monday weeks.  
* Adding `expand = c(0,0)` to the x and y scales removes excess space on each side of the plot, which also ensures the labels begin at the first bar.  
* Color and fill are defined in `geom_histogram()`

### Modifications {.tabset .tabset-fade}
<h3> Modifications </h3>


#### Modify axes  
<h4> Modify axes </h4>

<span style="color: darkgreen;">**_TIP:_** Remember that date-axis **labels** are independent from the aggregation of the data into bars</span>

To **modify the aggregation of data into bins/bars**, do one of the following:  

* Specify a `binwidth =` within `geom_histogram()` - for a column of class Date, the given number is interpreted in days  
* Specify `breaks = ` as a sequence of bin break-point dates  
* Group the rows into aggregated counts (by week, month, etc.) and feed the aggregated counts to `ggplot()`. See the tab on aggregated counts for more information.  


To **modify the date labels**, use `scale_x_date()` in one of these ways:  

* If your histogram bins are days, Monday weeks, months, or years:  
  * Use `date_breaks = ` to specify label frequency (e.g. "day", "week", "3 weeks", "month", or "year")
  * Use `date_minor_breaks = ` to specify frequency of minor vertical gridlines between date labels  
  * Add `expand = c(0,0)` to begin the labels at the first bar (otherwise, first label will shift forward depending on specified frequency)  
  * Use `date_labels = ` to specify format of date labels - see the Dates page for tips (use `\n` for a new line)  
* If your histogram bins are Sunday weeks:  
  * Use `breaks = ` and `minor_breaks = ` by providing a sequence of dates for breaks
  * You can still use `date_labels = ` for formatting as described above  


To **create a sequence of dates**  
You can use `seq.Date()` from **base** R. You can start/end the sequence at a specific date (`as.Date("YYYY-MM-DD")`, or write flexible code to begin the sequence at a specific day of the week before the first case. An example of creating such flexible breaks is below:  

```{r, eval=F}
seq.Date(from = as.Date(floor_date(min(central_data$date_onset, na.rm=T),   "week", week_start = 1)),
         to   = as.Date(ceiling_date(max(central_data$date_onset, na.rm=T), "week", week_start = 1)),
         by   = "7 days")
```  

To achieve the "from" value (earliest date of the sequence), the minimum value in the column `date_onset` is fed to `floor_date()` from the **lubridate** package, which according to the above specified arguments produces the start date of that "week", given that the start of each week is a Monday (`week_start = 1`). Likewise, the "to" value (end date of the sequence) is specified using the inverse `ceiling_date()` function to produce the Monday *after* the last case. The "by" argument can be set to any length of days, weeks, or months.  

If using aggregated counts (for example an epiweek x-axis) your x-axis may not be Date class and may require use `scale_x_discrete()` instead of `scale_x_date()` - see ggplot tips page for more details.  

Set maximum and minimum date values using `limits = c()` within `scale_x_date()`. E.g. `scale_x_date(limits = c(as.Date("2014-04-01), NA))` sets a minimum but leaves the maximum open.  

<span style="color: orange;">**_CAUTION:_** Caution using limits! They remove all data outside the limits, which can impact y-axis max/min, modeling, and other statistics. Strongly consider instead using limits by adding `coord_cartesian()` to your plot, which acts as a "zoom" without removing data. </span>

<span style="color: red;">**_DANGER:_** Be cautious setting the y-axis scale breaks (e.g. 0 to 30 by 5: `seq(0, 30, 5)`). Static numbers can cut-off your data if the data changes!.</span>

#### Color by groups
<h4> Color by groups </h4>

**Designate a column containing groups**  

In any of the code template (Sunday weeks, Monday weeks), make the following changes:  

* Add the *aesthetics* argument `aes()` within the `geom_histogram()` (don't forget comma afterward) 
* **Within `aes()`**, provide the grouping column name to `group = ` and `fill = ` (no quotes needed). `group` is necessary, while `fill` changes the color of the bar.  
* Remove any `fill =` argument outside of the `aes()`, as it will override the one inside  
* Arguments *inside* `aes()` will apply by group, whereas any *outside* will apply to all bars (e.g. you may want `color = ` outside, so each bar has the same color perimeter/border)  

```
geom_histogram(
    aes(group = gender, fill = gender))
```

**Adjust colors**:  

* To manually adjust the bar fill color of each group, use `scale_fill_manual()` (note `scale_color_manual()` is different!).
  * Use the `values = ` argument to apply a vector of colors.  
  * Use `na.value = ` to specify a color for missing values.  
  * ! While you *can* use the `labels = ` argument in `scale_fill_manual()` change the legend text labels - it is easy to accidentally give labels in the incorrect order and have an incorrect legend! It is recommended to instead convert the group column to class Factor and designate factor `labels` and order, as explained below.  
* To adjust the colors via a **color scale**, see the page on ggplot tips
  

**Adjust the stacking order and Legend**  

Stacking order, and the labels for each group in the legend, is best adjusted by classifying the group column as class Factor. You can then designate the levels and their labels, and the order (which is reflected in stack order).  

Step 1: Before making the ggplot, convert the `group` column to class Factor using `factor()` from **base** R.  
For example, with a column "gender" with values "m" and "f" and `NA`, this can be put in a `mutate()` command as:  
```
dataset <- dataset %>% 
  mutate(gender = factor(gender,
                    levels = c(NA, "f", "m"),
                    labels = c("Missing", "Female", "Male"),
                    exclude = NULL))
```
The above code establishes the levels, in the ordering that missing values are "first" (and will appear on top). Then the labels that will show are given in the same order. Lastly, the exclude statement ensures that `NA` is included in the ordering (by default `factor()` ignores `NA`).  

Read more about factors in their dedicated handbook page (LINK).  

**Adjusting the legend**  

Read more about legends in the ggplot tips page. Here are a few highlights:  

* `theme(legend.position = "top")` (or "bottom", "left", "right")
* `theme(legend.direction = "horizontal")`  
* `theme(legend.title = element_blank())` to have no title  

See the page of ggplot() tips for more details on legends.

```


**Display bars side-by-side**  

Side-by-side display of group bars (as opposed to stacked) is specified within `geom_histogram()` with `position = "dodge"`.  
If there are more than two value groups, these can become difficult to read. Consider instead using a faceted plot (small multiples) (see tab). To improve readability in this example, missing gender values are removed.

#### Faceting/small-multiples
<h4> Faceting/small-multiples </h4>

As with other ggplots, you can create facetted plots ("small multiples") off values in a column. As explained in the ggplot tips page of this handbook, you can use either:  

* `facet_wrap()`
* `facet_grid()`

For epicurves, `facet_wrap()` is typically easiest as it is likely that you only need to facet on one column. The general syntax is `facet_wrap(rows ~ cols)`, where to the left of the tilde (~) is the name of a column to be spread across the "rows" of the new plot, and to the right of the tilde is the name of a column to be spread across the "columns" of the new plot. 

**Most simply, just use one column name, to the right of the tilde**: `facet_wrap(~age_cat)`.  


**Free axes**  
You will need to decide whether the scales (`scales = `) of the axes for each facet are "fixed" to the same dimensions (default), or "free" (meaning they will change based on the data within the facet). You can also specify "free_x" or "free_y" to release in only one dimension.  


**Number of cols and rows**  
This can be specified with `ncol = ` and `nrow = ` within `facet_wrap()`. 


**Order of panels**  
To change the order of appearance, change the underlying order of the levels of the factor column used to create the facets.  


**Aesthetics**  
Font size and face, strip color, etc. can be modified through `theme()` with arguments like:  

* `strip.text = element_text()` (size, colour, face, angle...)
* `strip.background = element_rect()` (e.g. element_rect(fill="red"))

The position of the strip can be modified as the `strip.position = ` argument within `facet_wrap()` (e.g. "bottom", "top", "left", "right")


**Strip labels**  
Labels of the facet plots can be modified through the "labels" of the column as a factor, or by the use of a "labeller".  

Make a labeller like this, using the function `as_labeller()` from **ggplot2**:  

```{r, class.source = 'fold-show'}
my_labels <- as_labeller(c(
     "0-4"   = "Ages 0-4",
     "5-9"   = "Ages 5-9",
     "10-14" = "Ages 10-14",
     "15-19" = "Ages 15-19",
     "20-29" = "Ages 20-29",
     "30-49" = "Ages 30-49",
     "50-69" = "Ages 50-69",
     "70+"   = "Over age 70"))
```

        color = "black",                       # arguments outside aes() apply to all data
        breaks = bin_breaks)+                  # see breaks defined above

        strip.text = element_text(face = "bold", size = 10),
        strip.background = element_rect(fill = "grey"))+               # axis titles in bold
  
  # create facets
  facet_wrap(~age_cat,
             ncol = 4,
             strip.position = "top",
             labeller = my_labels)+             
  
  # labels
  labs(title    = "Weekly incidence of cases, by age category",
       subtitle = "Subtitle",

```

See this [link](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/labellers.html) for more information on labellers.  

**Add total epidemic to background**  
Add a separate `geom_histogram()` command *before* the current one. Specify that the data used is the data *without* the column used for faceting (see `select()`). Then, specify a color like "grey" and a degree of transparency to make it appear in the background.  

```
geom_histogram(data = select(central_data, -age_cat), color = "grey", alpha = 0.5)+
```

Note that the y-axis maximum is now based on the height of the entire epidemic. Click "Code" to see the code.

```

**Create one facet with ALL data**  
To do this, you duplicate all the data (double the number of rows in the dataset) and in the faceted column have a new value (e.g. "all") which indicates all the duplicated rows. A helped function is below that enables this:  

```{r}
# Define helper function
CreateAllFacet <- function(df, col){
     df$facet <- df[[col]]
     temp <- df
     temp$facet <- "all"
     merged <-rbind(temp, df)
     
     # ensure the facet value is a factor
     merged[[col]] <- as.factor(merged[[col]])
     
     return(merged)
}

# Create dataset that is duplicated, to show "all zones" as another facet level
central_data2 <- CreateAllFacet(central_data, col = "age_cat") %>%
  mutate(facet = factor(facet,
                        levels = c("all", "0-4", "5-9", "10-14", "15-19", "20-29", "30-49", "50-69", "70+")))

# check
table(central_data2$facet, useNA = "always")
```

Notable changes to the ggplot command are:  

* The data used is now central_data2 (double the rows, with new column "facet")
* Labeller will need to be updated, if used  
* To achieve long/thin plot, facet variable moved to rows side of equation, replaced by "." `facet_wrap(facet~.)`, and `ncol = 1` 
 
You may also need to adjust the width and height of the save plot image (see `ggsave()`).  


```{r, fig.height=10, fig.width=3, class.source = 'fold-hide'}
ggplot(central_data2, aes(x = date_onset)) + 
  
  # actual epicurves by group
  geom_histogram(
        aes(group = age_cat, fill = age_cat),  # arguments inside aes() apply by group
        color = "black",                       # arguments outside aes() apply to all data
        breaks = bin_breaks)+                  # see breaks defined above

```


#### Moving averages
<h4> Moving averages </h4>  

Add a moving averages to a `ggplot()` epicurve in one of two ways:  

1)  Plot the pre-calculated moving average:  
      + Aggregate the data as necessary (daily, weekly, etc.)  
      + Calculate the moving average  
      + Add the moving average to the ggplot (e.g. with `geom_line()`)  
2) Calculate on-the-fly within the `ggplot()` command  


##### **Using slider**  

In this approach, the moving average is calculated in the dataset prior to plotting:  

* Within `mutate()`, a new column is created to hold the average. `slide_index()` from **slider** package is used as shown below.  
* In the `ggplot()`, a `geom_line()` is added after the histogram, reflecting the moving average.  

See the helpful online [vignette for the **slider** package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/slider/vignettes/slider.html)  


```{r class.source = 'fold-show'}
pacman::p_load(slider)  # slider used to calculate rolling averages

# make dataset of daily counts and 7-day moving average
#######################################################
ll_counts_7day <- linelist %>% 
  ## count cases by date
  count(date_onset,
        name = "new_cases") %>%   # name of new column
  filter(!is.na(date_onset)) %>%  # remove cases with missing date_onset
  
  ## calculate the average number of cases in the preceding 7 days
  mutate(
    avg_7day = slider::slide_index(    # create new column
      new_cases,                       # calculate based on value in new_cases column
      .i = date_onset,                 # index is date_onset col, so non-present dates are included in window 
      .f = ~mean(.x, na.rm = TRUE),    # function is mean() with missing values removed
      .before = 6,                     # window is the day and 6-days before
      .complete = FALSE),              # must be FALSE for unlist() to work in next step
    avg_7day = unlist(avg_7day))


# plot
######
ggplot(data = ll_counts_7day, aes(x = date_onset)) +
    geom_histogram(aes(y = new_cases),
                   fill="#92a8d1",
                   stat = "identity",
                   position = "stack",
                   colour = "#92a8d1")+ 
    geom_line(aes(y = avg_7day, lty = "7-day \nrolling avg"),
              color="red",
              size = 1) + 
    scale_x_date(date_breaks = "1 month",
                 date_labels = '%d/%m',
                 expand = c(0,0)) +
    scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0,0),
                       limits = c(0, NA)) + 
    labs(x="",
         y ="Number of confirmed cases",
         fill = "Legend")+ 
    theme_minimal()+
    theme(legend.title = element_blank())  # removes title of legend
```

##### **Using tidyquant**  

Using the **tidyquant** package to calculate the moving average on-the-fly (within `ggplot()`).  

This option is more difficult to modify than pre-calculating the moving average. By default,`geom_ma()` uses the Simple Moving Average (SMA) (`TRR::SMA()`). See documentation by entering `?SMA` in your R console. Calculates the arithmatic mean over the past `n` observations. Also note how the moving average does not begin as early as the previous example.

       y = "Daily case incidence",
       title = "Daily case incidence, with 7-day moving average")
```


#### Tentative data  
<h4> Tentative data </h4>  


The most recent data shown in epicurves should often be marked as tentative, or subject to reporting delays. This can be done in by adding a vertical line and/or rectangle over a specified number of days. Here are two options:  

1) Use `annotate()`:  
  + **Pros:** Transparency of rectangle is easy. **Cons:** Items will not appear in legend.  
  + For a line use `annotate(geom = "segment")`. Provide `x`, `xend`, `y`, and `yend`. Adjust size, linetype (`lty`), and color.  
  + For a rectangle use `annotate(geom = "rect")`. Provide xmin/xmax/ymin/ymax. Adjust color and alpha.  
2) Use `geom_segment()` and `geom_rect()`:  
  * **Pros:** Items can easily appear in legend. **Cons:** Difficult to achieve semi-transparency of rectangle.  
  * Provide the same x/y arguments as noted above for `annotate()`  
  

<span style="color: orange;">**_CAUTION:_** While you can use `geom_rect()` to draw a rectangle, adjusting the transparency (alpha) does not work in a linelist context. This function overlays a rectangle for each observation/row!. Try a very low alpha (e.g. 0.01), or use `annotate(geom = "rect")` as shown. </span>




##### **Using `annotate()`** 

* Within `annotate(geom = "rect")`, the `xmin` and `xmax` arguments must be given inputs of class Date.  
* Note that because these data are aggregated into weekly bars, and the last bar extends to the Monday after the last data point, the shaded region may appear to cover 4 weeks  
* `annotate()` [online example](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/annotate.html)

           ymin  = 0,
           ymax  = Inf,
           alpha = 0.2,          # alpha easy and intuitive to adjust using annotate()
           fill  = "red")+
  
  # add black vertical line on top of other layers
  annotate("segment",
           x     = max(central_data$date_onset, na.rm = T) - 21, # 21 days before last data
           xend  = max(central_data$date_onset, na.rm = T) - 21, 
           y     = 0,         # line begins at y = 0
           yend  = Inf,       # line to top of plot
           size  = 2,         # line size
           color = "black",
           lty   = "solid")+   # linetype e.g. "solid", "dashed"

  # add text in rectangle
  annotate("text",

           y = 20,
           label = "Subject to reporting delays",
           angle = 90)
```




The same black vertical line can be achieved with the code below, but using `geom_vline()` you lose the ability to control the height:  

```
geom_vline(xintercept = max(central_data$date_onset, na.rm = T) - 21,
           size = 2,
           color = "black")

               size = 2)+

```


#### Dual axis
<h4> Dual axis </h4>
Two axes






#### Multi-level date labels  
<h4> Multi-level date labels </h4>

Here is an option if you want multi-level date labels, without duplicating the lower label levels (e.g. for year or month).  

Remember, you can can use tools like `\n` *within* the `date_labels` or `labels` arguments to put parts of each label on a new line below. However, the code below helps you take years or months (for example) on a lower line *and only once*.  


A few notes on the code below:  

* Case counts are aggregated into weeks for aesthetic reasons. See Epicurves page (aggregated data tab) for details.  
* A line is used instead of a histogram, as the faceting approach below does not work well with histograms.  


Aggreagate the weekly counts

```{r out.width = c('50%', '50%'), fig.show='hold'}

# Create dataset of case counts by week
#######################################
central_weekly <- linelist %>%
  filter(hospital == "Central Hospital") %>%           # filter linelist
  mutate(week = lubridate::floor_date(date_onset, unit = "weeks")) %>%  
  count(week, .drop=F) %>%                             # summarize weekly case counts
  filter(!is.na(week)) %>%                             # remove cases with missing onset_date
  complete(week = seq.Date(from = min(week),           # fill-in all weeks with no cases reported
                           to   = max(week),

#### Aggregating linelist data  
<h4> Aggregating linelist data   </h4>

To learn generally how to group and aggregate data, see the handbook page on Grouping/Aggregating.  

In this circumstance, we demonstrate aggregating into weeks, months, and days.  


##### **Weeks**  


Create a new column that is weeks, then use `group_by()` with `summarize()` to get weekly case counts.  

To aggregate into weeks and show ALL weeks (even ones with no cases), do this:  


1) Create a new 'week' column within `mutate()`, using `floor_date()` from the **lubridate** package:  
    + use `unit = ` to set the desired time unit, e.g. "week`  
    + use `week_start = ` to set the weekday start of the week (7 = Sunday, 1 = Monday)  

2) Follow with `complete()` to ensure that all weeks appear - even those with no cases.  


For example:  

```{r}
# Make dataset of weekly case counts
weekly_counts <- linelist %>% 
  mutate(
    week = lubridate::floor_date(date_onset,
                                 unit = "week")) %>%  # new column of week of onset
  count(week) %>%                                     # group data by week and count rows per group
  filter(!is.na(week)) %>%                            # remove entries for cases missing date_onset
  complete(week = seq.Date(from = min(week),          # fill-in all weeks with no cases reported
                           to = max(week),
                           by="week")) %>% 
  ungroup()                                           # deactivate grouping
```

Here are the first 50 rows of the resulting dataframe:  

```{r message=FALSE, echo=F}
DT::datatable(head(weekly_counts, 50), rownames = FALSE, filter="top", options = list(pageLength = 5, scrollX=T) )
```

**Alternatively, you can use the [**aweek**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/aweek/vignettes/introduction.html) package's `date2week()` function**. As shown below, set `week_start = ` to "Sunday", or "Monday", etc. Set `floor_date = TRUE` so the output is YYYY-Www. Set `factor = TRUE` so that all possible weeks are included, even if there are no cases (this replaces the `complete()` step in the **lubridate** approach above). You can also use `numeric = TRUE` if you want only the week number (note this will not distinguish between years). 

```{r}
# Make dataset of weekly case counts
weekly_counts <- linelist %>% 
  mutate(week = aweek::date2week(date_onset,          # new column of week of onset
                                 floor_day = T,       # show as weeks without weekday
                                 factor = TRUE)) %>%  # include all possible weeks
  count(week) %>% 
  ungroup()                                           # deactivate grouping

# Optional: add column of start DATE for each week - e.g. for ggplot() when date x-axis is expected
# note: add this step AFTER the above code, to ensure all weeks are present
weekly_counts <- weekly_counts %>% 
  mutate(week_as_date = aweek::week2date(week, week_start = "Monday")) # output is Monday date of each week

##### **Months**  

To aggregate cases into months, again use `floor_date()` from the **lubridate** package, but with the argument `unit = "months"`. This rounds each date down to the 1st of its month. The output will be class Date.  

Note that in the `complete()` step we also use "months"  


```{r}
# Make dataset of weekly case counts
monthly_counts <- linelist %>% 
  mutate(month = lubridate::floor_date(date_onset, unit = "months")) %>%   # new column, 1st of month of onset
  count(month) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(month)) %>% 
  complete(month = seq.Date(min(month),     # fill-in all months with no cases reported
                            max(month),
                            by="month"))    
```

```{r message=FALSE, echo=F}
DT::datatable(head(monthly_counts, 50), rownames = FALSE, filter="top", options = list(pageLength = 5, scrollX=T) )
```


##### **Days**  

To aggregate a linelist into days, use the same approach but there is no need to create a new column. Use `group_by()` on the date column (e.g. `date_onset`).  

If plotting a histogram, missing days in the data are not a problem as long as the column is class Date. However, it may be important for other types of plots or tables to have all possible days apear in the data. This is done with: `tidyr::complete()`

```{r, eval=F}
# Make dataset of weekly case counts
daily_counts <- linelist %>% 
  count(date_onset) %>%                           # count number of rows per unique date
  filter(!is.na(date_onset)) %>%                  # remove aggregation of rows that were missing date_onset
  complete(date_onset = seq.Date(min(date_onset), # ensure all days appear
                                 max(date_onset),
                                 by="day"))  
```

## Aggregated data {.tabset .tabset-fade}
<h2> Aggregated data </h2>


Often instead of a linelist, you begin with aggregated counts from facilities, districts, etc. You can make an epicurve from `ggplot()` but the code will be slightly different. The incidence package does not support aggregate data.

This section will utilize the `count_data` dataset that was imported earlier, in the data preparation section. It is the `linelist` aggregated to day-hospital counts. The first 50 rows are displayed below.  

```{r message=FALSE, echo=F}
# display the linelist data as a table
DT::datatable(head(count_data, 50), rownames = FALSE, filter="top", options = list(pageLength = 5, scrollX=T) )
```

As before, we must ensure date variables are correctly classified.

```{r aggregated_dates}
# Convert Date variable to Date class
class(count_data$date_hospitalisation)
```

We can plot a daily epicurve from these data. Here are the differences:  

* Specify `y = ` to the counts column within the primary aesthetics `aes()`
* Use of `stat = "identity"` within `geom_histogram()` indicates that the y-values could be counts from the `y = ` column in `aes()`  


```{r}
ggplot(data = count_data, aes(x = as.Date(date_hospitalisation), y = n_cases))+
     geom_histogram(stat = "identity")+
     labs(x = "Week of report", 
          y = "Number of cases",
          Title = "Daily case incidence, from daily count data")
```

**aggregate further**  

To aggregated further, into weeks, we use the package **lubridate** and function `floor_date()`, as described above. Note that we use `group_by()` and `summarize()` in place of `count()` becase we need to `sum()` case counts instead of just counting the number of rows per group.  
 
```{r aggregated_epiweek}
# Create weekly dataset with epiweek column
count_data_weekly <- count_data %>%
  mutate(epiweek = lubridate::floor_date(date_hospitalisation, "week")) %>% 
  group_by(hospital, epiweek, .drop=F) %>% 
  summarize(n_cases_weekly = sum(n_cases, na.rm=T))   
```

The first 50 rows of `count_data` are displayed below.  

```{r message=FALSE, echo=F}
# display the linelist data as a table
DT::datatable(head(count_data_weekly, 50), rownames = FALSE, filter="top", options = list(pageLength = 5, scrollX=T) )
```

For the plotting we also specify the factor level order of `hospital`.  

```{r}
count_data_weekly <- count_data_weekly %>% 
  mutate(hospital = factor(hospital,
                           levels = c("Missing", "Port Hospital", "Military Hospital", "Central Hospital", "St. Mark's Maternity Hospital (SMMH)", "Other")))
```

Now plot by epiweek.

```{r}
ggplot(data = count_data_weekly,
       aes(x = epiweek,
           y = n_cases_weekly,
           group = hospital,
           fill = hospital))+
  
  geom_histogram(stat = "identity")+
     
  # labels for x-axis
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "2 months",      # labels every 2 months 
               date_minor_breaks = "1 month", # gridlines every month
               date_labels = '%b\n%Y')+       #labeled by month with year below
     
  # Choose color palette (uses RColorBrewer package)
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Pastel2")+ 
  
  theme_minimal()+
  
  labs(x = "Week of onset", 
       y = "Weekly case incidence",
       fill = "Hospital",
       title = "Weekly case incidence, from aggregated count data by hospital")
```

## Dual-axis {.tabset .tabset-fade}  
<h2> Dual-axis </h2>

Although there are fierce discussions about the validity of this within the data visualization community, many supervisors want to see an epicurve or similar chart with a percent overlaid with a second axis.

In ggplot it is difficult to do this, except for the case where you are showing a line reflecting the proportion of a category shown in the bars below.  

See the handbook page on ggplot tips for details on how to make a second axis.
