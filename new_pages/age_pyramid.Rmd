# Age pyramids and Likert-scales {}  

Age pyramids can be useful to show patterns by age group. They can show gender, or the distribution of other characteristics. These tabs demonstrate how to produce age pyramids using:  

* Fast & easy:   Using the **apyramid** package  
* More flexible: Using `ggplot()`  
* Having baseline demographics displayed in the background of the pyramid  
* Using pyramid-style plots to show other types of data (e.g responses to **Likert-style** survey questions)  


<!-- ======================================================= -->
## Overview {}

```{r, out.width = c('50%', '50%'), fig.show='hold', echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "pop_pyramid_baseline.png"))

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "likert.png"))
```


Age/gender demographic pyramids in R are generally made with `ggplot()` by creating two barplots (one for each gender), converting one's values to negative values, and flipping the x and y axes to display the barplots vertically. 

Here we offer a quick approach through the **apyramid** package:  

* More customizable code using the raw `ggplot()` commands  
* How to combine case demographic data and compare with that of a baseline population (as shown above)  
* Application of these methods to show other types of data (e.g. responses to Likert-style survey questions)  



<!-- ======================================================= -->
## Preparation {}

For this tab we use the `linelist` dataset that is cleaned in the Cleaning tab.  

To make a traditional age/sex demographic pyramid, the data must first be cleaned in the following ways:  

* The gender column must be cleaned.  
* Age should be in an age category column, and should be an of class Factor (with correctly ordered levels)

### Load packages {-}  

This code chunk shows the loading of packages required for the analyses. In this handbook we emphasize `p_load()` from **pacman**, which installs the package if necessary and loads it for use. You can also load packages with `library()` from **base** R. See the page on [R basics] for more information on R packages.  

```{r}
pacman::p_load(rio,       # to import data
               here,      # to locate files
               tidyverse, # to clean, handle, and plot the data (includes ggplot2 package)
               apyramid,  # a package dedicated to creating age pyramids
               stringr)   # working with strings for titles, captions, etc.
```

### Import data {-}  

We import the dataset of cases from a simulated Ebola epidemic. If you want to download the data to follow along step-by-step, see instruction in the [Datasets used] page.  

```{r, echo=F}
linelist <- rio::import(here("data", "linelist_cleaned.rds"))
```

```{r, eval=F}
linelist <- rio::import("linelist_cleaned.csv")
```

### Check column classes {-}  

Ensure that the column you want to use for age is class Numeric.  

```{r}
class(linelist$age_years)
```


<!-- ======================================================= -->
## **apyramid** package {}

The package **apyramid** allows you to quickly make an age pyramid. For more nuanced situations, see the tab on using `ggplot()` to make age pyramids. You can read more about the **apyramid** package in its Help page by entering `?age_pyramid` in your R console. 

### Linelist data  


Using the cleaned linelist dataset, we can create an age pyramid with just one simple command. If you need help cleaning your data, see the handbook page on Cleaning data and core functions (LINK). In this command:  

* The *data* argument is set as the `linelist` dataframe  
* The *age_group* argument is set to the name (in quotes) of the numeric category variable (in this case `age_cat5`)  
* The *split_by* argument (bar colors) should be a binary column (in this case "gender")  

```{r, warning=F, message=F}
apyramid::age_pyramid(data = linelist,
                      age_group = "age_cat5",
                      split_by = "gender")
```


The same result can be shown as percents of all cases, instead of counts, by setting `proportional = TRUE`.  

```{r, warning=F, message=F}
apyramid::age_pyramid(data = linelist,
                      age_group = "age_cat5",
                      split_by = "gender",
                      proportional = TRUE)
```


When using **agepyramid** package, if the `split_by` column is binary (e.g. male/female, or yes/no), then the result will appear as a pyramid. However if there are more than two values in the `split_by` column (not including `NA`), the pyramid will appears as a faceted barplot with empty bars in the background indicating the range of the un-faceted data set for the age group. Values of split_by will appear as labels at top of each facet. For example below if the `split_by` variable is "hospital".  

```{r, warning=F, message=F}
apyramid::age_pyramid(data = linelist,
                      age_group = "age_cat5",
                      split_by = "hospital",
                      na.rm = FALSE)        # show a bar for patients missing age, (note: this changes the pyramid into a faceted barplot)
```

**Missing values**  
Rows missing values for the `split_by` or `age_group` columns, if coded as `NA`, will not trigger the faceting shown above. By default these rows will not be shown. However you can specify that they appear, in an adjacent barplot and as a separate age group at the top, by specifying `na.rm = FALSE`.  

```{r, warning=F, message=F}
apyramid::age_pyramid(data = linelist,
                      age_group = "age_cat5",
                      split_by = "gender",
                      na.rm = FALSE)         # show patients missing age or gender
```

**Proportions, colors, & aesthetics**  

By default, the bars display counts (not %), a dashed mid-line for each group is shown, and the colors are green/purple. Each of these parameters can all be adjusted, as shown below:  

You can also add additional `ggplot()` commands to the plot using the standard `ggplot()` "+" syntax, such as aesthetic themes and label adjustments: 

```{r, warning=F, message=F}
apyramid::age_pyramid(data = linelist,
                      age_group = "age_cat5",
                      split_by = "gender",
                      proportional = TRUE,                  # show percents, not counts
                      show_midpoint = FALSE,                # remove bar mid-point line
                      #pal = c("orange", "purple")          # can specify alt. colors here (but not labels, see below)
                      )+                 
  
  # additional ggplot commands
  theme_minimal()+                                          # simplify the background
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("orange", "purple"),         # to specify colors AND labels
                     labels = c("Male", "Female"))+
  labs(y = "Percent of all cases",                          # note that x and y labels are switched (see ggplot tab)
       x = "Age categories",                          
       fill = "Gender", 
       caption = "My data source and caption here",
       title = "Title of my plot",
       subtitle = "Subtitle with \n a second line...")+
  theme(
    legend.position = "bottom",                             # move legend to bottom
    axis.text = element_text(size = 10, face = "bold"),     # fonts/sizes, see ggplot tips page
    axis.title = element_text(size = 12, face = "bold"))
```



### Aggregated data  

The examples above assume your data are in a linelist-like format, with one row per observation. If your data are already aggregated into counts by age category, you can still use the **apyramid** package, as shown below.  

This code aggregates the linelist data into counts by age category and gender, in a "wide" format. Learn more about [Grouping data] and [Pivoting data] in their respective pages:  

```{r, warning=F, message=F}
demo_agg <- linelist %>% 
  count(age_cat5, gender, name = "cases") %>% 
  pivot_wider(id_cols = age_cat5, names_from = gender, values_from = cases) %>% 
  rename(`missing_gender` = `NA`)
```

...which makes the dataset looks like this: with columns for age category, and male counts, female counts, and missing counts.  

```{r, echo=F, warning=F, message=F}
# View the aggregated data
DT::datatable(demo_agg, rownames = FALSE, options = list(pageLength = 5, scrollX=T), class = 'white-space: nowrap' )
```

To set-up these data for the age pyramid, we will pivot the data to be "long" with the `pivot_longer()` function from **dplyr**. This is because `ggplot()` generally prefers "long" data, and **apyramid** is using `ggplot()`.  

```{r, warning=F, message=F}
# pivot the aggregated data into long format
demo_agg_long <- demo_agg %>% 
  pivot_longer(c(f, m, missing_gender),            # cols to elongate
               names_to = "gender",                # name for new col of categories
               values_to = "counts") %>%           # name for new col of counts
  mutate(gender = na_if(gender, "missing_gender")) # convert "missing_gender" to NA
``` 

```{r, echo=F, warning=F, message=F}
# View the aggregated data
DT::datatable(demo_agg_long, rownames = FALSE, filter="top", options = list(pageLength = 5, scrollX=T), class = 'white-space: nowrap' )
```

Then use the `split_by` and `count` arguments of `age_pyramid()` to specify the respective columns:  

```{r, warning=F, message=F}
apyramid::age_pyramid(data = demo_agg_long,
                      age_group = "age_cat5",
                      split_by = "gender",
                      count = "counts")      # give the column name for the aggregated counts
```

Note in the above, that the factor order of "m" and "f" is different (pyramid reversed). To adjust the order you must re-define gender in the aggredated data as a Factor and order the levels as desired.  




<!-- ======================================================= -->
## `ggplot()` {}

Using `ggplot()` to build your age pyramid allows for more flexibility, but requires more effort and understanding of how `ggplot()` works. It is also easier to accidentally make mistakes.  

**apyramid** uses `ggplot()` in the background (and accepts `ggplot()` commands added), but this page shows how to adjust or recreate a pyramid only using `ggplot()`, if you wish.  



<!-- ======================================================= -->
### Constructing the plot {} 

First, understand that to make such a pyramid using `ggplot()` the approach is to:

* Within the `ggplot()`, create **two** graphs by age category. Create one for each of the two grouping values (in this case gender). See filters applied to the `data` arguments in each `geom_histogram()` commands below.  

* If using `geom_histogram()`, the graphs operate off the numeric column (e.g. `age_years`), whereas if using `geom_barplot()` the graphs operate from an ordered Factor (e.g. `age_cat5`). 

* One graph will have positive count values, while the other will have its counts converted to negative values - this allows both graphs to be seen and compared against each other in the same plot.  

* The command `coord_flip()` switches the X and Y axes, resulting in the graphs turning vertical and creating the pyramid.

* Lastly, the counts-axis labels must be specified so they appear as "positive" counts on both sides of the pyramid (despite the underlying values on one side being negative). 

A **simple** version of this, using `geom_histogram()`, is below:

```{r, warning=F, message=F}
  # begin ggplot
  ggplot(data = linelist, aes(x = age, fill = gender)) +
  
  # female histogram
  geom_histogram(data = filter(linelist, gender == "f"),
                 breaks = seq(0,85,5),
                 colour = "white") +
  
  # male histogram (values converted to negative)
  geom_histogram(data = filter(linelist, gender == "m"),
                 breaks = seq(0,85,5),
                 aes(y=..count..*(-1)),
                 colour = "white") +
  
  # flip the X and Y axes
  coord_flip() +
  
  # adjust counts-axis scale
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(-600, 900),
                     breaks = seq(-600,900,100),
                     labels = abs(seq(-600, 900, 100)))
```

<span style="color: red;">**_DANGER:_** If the **limits** of your counts axis are set too low, and a counts bar exceeds them, the bar will disappear entirely or be artificially shortened! Watch for this if analyzing data which is routinely updated. Prevent it by having your count-axis limits auto-adjust to your data, as below.</span>  

There are many things you can change/add to this simple version, including:  

* Auto adjust counts-axis count scale to your data (avoid errors discussed in warning below)  
* Manually specify colors and legend labels  

Convert counts to percents:  

```{r, warning=F, message=F}
# create dataset with proportion of total
pyramid_data <- linelist %>%
  count(age_cat5, gender, name = "counts") %>% 
  ungroup() %>%                                   # ungroup so percent calculations are not by group
  mutate(percent = round(100*(counts / sum(counts, na.rm=T)),1), 
         percent = case_when(
            gender == "f" ~ percent,
            gender == "m" ~ -percent,
            TRUE          ~ NA_real_))
```

Importantly here we save the max and min (which is the max in the opposite direction) percents so we know how tall the scale should be. These will be used in the `ggplot()` command below.    
```{r}
max_per <- max(pyramid_data$percent, na.rm=T)
min_per <- min(pyramid_data$percent, na.rm=T)

max_per
min_per
```

Finally we make the `ggplot()` on the percent data. We specify `scale_y_continuous()` to extend the pre-defined lengths in each direction (positive and "negative"). We use `floor()` and `ceiling()` to round decimals the appropriate direction (down or up) for the side of the axis.  

```{r, warning=F, message=F}
# begin ggplot
  ggplot()+  # default x-axis is age in years;

  # case data graph
  geom_bar(data = pyramid_data,
           stat = "identity",
           aes(x = age_cat5,
               y = percent,
               fill = gender),        # 
           colour = "white")+         # white around each bar
  
  # flip the X and Y axes to make pyramid vertical
  coord_flip()+
  

  # adjust the axes scales (remember they are flipped now!)
  #scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0,100,5), labels = seq(0,100,5)) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(min_per, max_per),
                     breaks = seq(floor(min_per), ceiling(max_per), 2),
                     labels = paste0(abs(seq(floor(min_per), ceiling(max_per), 2)), "%"))+

  # designate colors and legend labels manually
  scale_fill_manual(
    values = c("f" = "orange",
               "m" = "darkgreen"),
    labels = c("Female", "Male"),
  ) +
  
  # label values (remember X and Y flipped now)
  labs(
    x = "Age group",
    y = "Percent of total",
    fill = NULL,
    caption = stringr::str_glue("Data are from linelist \nn = {nrow(linelist)} (age or sex missing for {sum(is.na(linelist$gender) | is.na(linelist$age_years))} cases) \nData as of: {format(Sys.Date(), '%d %b %Y')}")) +
  
  # optional aesthetic themes
  theme(
    panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
    panel.background = element_blank(),
    axis.line = element_line(colour = "black"),
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5), 
    plot.caption = element_text(hjust=0, size=11, face = "italic")) + 
  
  ggtitle(paste0("Age and gender of cases"))
    

```



<!-- ======================================================= -->
### Compare to baseline  

With the flexibility of `ggplot()`, you can have a second layer of bars in the background that represent the true population pyramid. This can provide a nice visualization to compare the observed counts with the baseline.  

Import and view the population data
```{r echo=F}
# import the population demographics data
pop <- rio::import(here::here("data", "country_demographics.csv"))
```

```{r eval=F}
# import the population demographics data
pop <- rio::import("country_demographics.csv")
```

```{r, echo=F, warning=F, message=F}
# display the linelist data as a table
DT::datatable(pop, rownames = FALSE, filter="top", options = list(pageLength = 10, scrollX=T), class = 'white-space: nowrap' )
```
First some data management steps:  

Here we record the order of age categories that we want to appear. Due to some quirks the way the `ggplot()` is implemented, it is easiest to store these as a character vector and use them later in the plotting function.  

```{r}
# record correct age cat levels
age_levels <- c("0-4","5-9", "10-14", "15-19", "20-24",
                "25-29","30-34", "35-39", "40-44", "45-49",
                "50-54", "55-59", "60-64", "65-69", "70-74",
                "75-79", "80-84", "85+")
```

Combine the population and case data through the **dplyr** function `bind_rows()`:  

* First, ensure they have the *exact same* column names, age categories values, and gender values  
* Make them have the same data structure: columns of age category, gender, counts, and percent of total  
* Bind them together, one on-top of the other (`bind_rows()`)  



```{r, warning=F, message=F}
# create/transform populaton data, with percent of total
########################################################
pop_data <- pivot_longer(pop, c(m, f), names_to = "gender", values_to = "counts") %>% # pivot gender columns longer
  mutate(data = "population",                                                         # add column designating data source
         percent  = round(100*(counts / sum(counts, na.rm=T)),1),                     # calculate % of total
         percent  = case_when(                                                        # if male, convert % to negative
                            gender == "f" ~ percent,
                            gender == "m" ~ -percent,
                            TRUE          ~ NA_real_))
```

Review the changed population dataset
```{r, echo=F, warning=F, message=F}
# display the linelist data as a table
DT::datatable(pop_data, rownames = FALSE, filter="top", options = list(pageLength = 5, scrollX=T), class = 'white-space: nowrap' )
```

Now implement the same for the case linelist.  Slightly different because it begins with case-rows, not counts.  

```{r, warning=F, message=F}
# create case data by age/gender, with percent of total
#######################################################
case_data <- linelist %>%
  group_by(age_cat5, gender) %>%  # aggregate linelist cases into age-gender groups
  summarize(counts = n()) %>%     # calculate counts per age-gender group
  ungroup() %>% 
  mutate(data = "cases",                                          # add column designating data source
         percent = round(100*(counts / sum(counts, na.rm=T)),1),  # calculate % of total for age-gender groups
         percent = case_when(                                     # convert % to negative if male
            gender == "f" ~ percent,
            gender == "m" ~ -percent,
            TRUE          ~ NA_real_))
```

Review the changed case dataset  

```{r, message=FALSE, echo=F}
# display the linelist data as a table
DT::datatable(case_data, rownames = FALSE, filter="top", options = list(pageLength = 5, scrollX=T), class = 'white-space: nowrap' )
```

Now the two datasets are combined, one on top of the other (same column names)
```{r, warning=F, message=F}
# combine case and population data (same column names, age_cat values, and gender values)
pyramid_data <- bind_rows(case_data, pop_data)
```

Store the maximum and minimum percent values, used in the plotting funtion to define the extent of the plot (and not cut off any bars!)  

```{r}
# Define extent of percent axis, used for plot limits
max_per <- max(pyramid_data$percent, na.rm=T)
min_per <- min(pyramid_data$percent, na.rm=T)
```

Now the plot is made with `ggplot()`: 

* One bar graph of population data (wider, more transparent bars)
* One bar graph of case data (small, more solid bars)

## Likert scale {}

The techniques used to make a population pyramid with `ggplot()` can also be used to make plots of Likert-scale survey data.  

```{r, eval=F, echo=F}
data_raw <- import("P:/Shared/equateur_mve_2020/lessons learned/Ebola After-Action Survey - HQ epi team (form responses).csv")


likert_data <- data_raw %>% 
  select(2, 4:11) %>% 
  rename(status = 1,
         Q1 = 2,
         Q2 = 3,
            Q3 = 4,
            Q4 = 5,
            Q5 = 6,
            Q6 = 7,
            Q7 = 8,
            Q8 = 9) %>% 
  mutate(status = case_when(
           stringr::str_detect(status, "Mar") ~ "Senior",
           stringr::str_detect(status, "Jan") ~ "Intermediate",
           stringr::str_detect(status, "Feb") ~ "Junior",
           TRUE ~ "Senior")) %>% 
  mutate(Q4 = recode(Q4, "Not applicable" = "Very Poor"))

table(likert_data$status)

rio::export(likert_data, here::here("data", "likert_data.csv"))
```

Import the data

```{r echo=F}
# import the likert survey response data
likert_data <- rio::import(here::here("data", "likert_data.csv"))
```

```{r, eval=F}
# import the likert survey response data
likert_data <- rio::import("likert_data.csv")
```

Start with data that looks like this, with a categorical classification of each respondent (`status`) and their answers to 8 questions on a 4-point Likert-type scale ("Very poor", "Poor", "Good", "Very good").  

```{r, echo=F, message=FALSE}
# display the linelist data as a table
DT::datatable(likert_data, rownames = FALSE, filter="top", options = list(pageLength = 10, scrollX=T), class = 'white-space: nowrap' )
```

First, some data management steps:  

* Pivot the data longer  
* Create new column `direction` depending on whether response was generally "positive" or "negative"  
* Set the Factor level order for the `status` column and the `Response` column  
* Store the max count value so limits of plot are appropriate  


```{r, warning=F, message=F}
melted <- pivot_longer(likert_data, Q1:Q8, names_to = "Question", values_to = "Response") %>% 
     mutate(direction = case_when(
               Response %in% c("Poor","Very Poor") ~ "Negative",
               Response %in% c("Good", "Very Good") ~ "Positive",
               TRUE ~ "Unknown"),
            status = factor(status, levels = rev(c(
                 "Senior", "Intermediate", "Junior"))),
            Response = factor(Response, levels = c("Very Good", "Good",
                                             "Very Poor", "Poor"))) # must reverse Very Poor and Poor for ordering to work

melted_max <- melted %>% 
   group_by(status, Question) %>% 
   summarize(n = n())
```

Just like in the `ggplot()` age pyramid, we save the max value to dynamically calibrate our axis scale.  

```{r}
melted_max <- max(melted_max$n, na.rm=T)
melted_max
```


Now make the plot:

```{r, warning=F, message=F}
# make plot
ggplot()+
     # bar graph of the "negative" responses 
     geom_bar(data = filter(melted,
                            direction == "Negative"), 
              aes(x = status,
                        y=..count..*(-1),    # counts inverted to negative
                        fill = Response),
                    color = "black",
                    closed = "left", 
                    position = "stack")+
     
     # bar graph of the "positive responses
     geom_bar(data = filter(melted, direction == "Positive"),
              aes(x = status, fill = Response),
              colour = "black",
              closed = "left",
              position = "stack")+
     
     # flip the X and Y axes
     coord_flip()+
  
     # Black vertical line at 0
     geom_hline(yintercept = 0, color = "black", size=1)+
     
    # convert labels to all positive numbers
    scale_y_continuous(limits = c(-ceiling(melted_max/10)*11, ceiling(melted_max/10)*10),   # seq from neg to pos by 10, edges rounded outward to nearest 5
                       breaks = seq(-ceiling(melted_max/10)*10, ceiling(melted_max/10)*10, 10),
                       labels = abs(unique(c(seq(-ceiling(melted_max/10)*10, 0, 10),
                                            seq(0, ceiling(melted_max/10)*10, 10))))) +
     
    # color scales manually assigned 
    scale_fill_manual(values = c("Very Good"  = "green4", # assigns colors
                                  "Good"      = "green3",
                                  "Poor"      = "yellow",
                                  "Very Poor" = "red3"),
                       breaks = c("Very Good", "Good", "Poor", "Very Poor"))+ # orders the legend
     
    
     
    # facet the entire plot so each question is a sub-plot
    facet_wrap(~Question, ncol = 3)+
     
    # labels, titles, caption
    labs(x = "Respondent status",
          y = "Number of responses",
          fill = "")+
     ggtitle(str_glue("Likert-style responses\nn = {nrow(likert_data)}"))+

     # aesthetic settings
     theme_minimal()+
     theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 12),
           axis.title = element_text(size = 14, face = "bold"),
           strip.text = element_text(size = 14, face = "bold"),  # facet sub-titles
           plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = "bold"),
           panel.background = element_rect(fill = NA, color = "black")) # black box around each facet
```
